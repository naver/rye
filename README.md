### RYE: Native Sharding RDBMS
Scalability problems in relational databases are perceived as a major disadvantage.
Sharding is one of the solutions to overcome the scalability problems,
but the lack of functionality supported by DBMS makes it difficult to apply for the application.
To solve it, we are developing RYE which is RDBMS supporting sharding functionality.

### RYE Features

* Analyze SQL and automatically route it to shard nodes
* Dynamically add shard nodes and redistribute data
* Ensure efficient search and record-level shard data integrity
* Provide a standardized programming API for developers
* Support online DDL that does not interfere with response and resource usage
* Use shardkey-based deadlock-free concurrency control and parallel replication
* Native HA
* Keep various monitoring information for each process into shared memory
* Provide remote backup
* Docker deployment


### Quickstart

#### Build on Linux
RYE builds successfully on 64-bit Linux (CentOS) environments. Other Linux distributions have not been tested.

**Compile**

To build RYE from the git-cloned source code,

```bash
$ ./autogen.sh
$ mkdir Release64
$ cd Release64
$ ../configure --prefix=$HOME/RYE
$ make
$ make install
```

#### Install

```bash
$ tar xvfz RYE.1.0.0.0617.tar.gz
$ mv RYE $HOME
$ export RYE=$HOME/RYE
$ export RYE_DATABASES=$HOME/db
$ export PATH=$RYE/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$RYE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export CLASSPATH=$RYE/jdbc/rye_jdbc.jar:$CLASS_PATH
$ rye --version
rye (Rye utilities)
Rye 1.0 (1.0.0.0617) (64bit release build for linux_gnu) (Oct 23 2017 12:53:00)
```

#### Run
To create and start demodb database, with single shard node
* HOST_IP=1.1.1.1
* SHARD_MGMT_PORT=40000

Execute service command at 1.1.1.1
```bash
$ rye service start
```

Execute shard init on a machine where RYE jdbc driver is installed
```bash
$ java rye.jdbc.admin.Shard init demodb 1.1.1.1 40000 --num-groups=10000
```

Execute service command at 1.1.1.1
```bash
$ rye service status
```

Connect to demodb database using jdbc connection url
(Can use a 3rd party SQL browser, such as the SQuirrel SQL Client)

```
jdbc:rye://1.1.1.1:40000/demodb:dba:/rw?charset=utf-8&queryTimeout=6000
```

Insert sample data

```SQL
CREATE SHARD TABLE mail (
   	uid  	VARCHAR,
   	mid  	INT,
   	title 	VARCHAR,
   	PRIMARY KEY (uid, mid)
) SHARD BY uid;

INSERT INTO mail VALUES ('id1', 1, 'hello user1');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES ('id2', 2, 'hello user2');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES ('id3', 3, 'hello user3');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES ('id4', 4, 'hello user4');
INSERT INTO mail VALUES ('id5', 5, 'hello user5');
```

Retrieve the data

```SQL
-- get shard node info
SELECT shard_nodeid(), count(*) FROM mail;
   shard_nodeid()   count(*)   
 ==============================
   1                5          

-- query with shardkey condition
SELECT title FROM mail WHERE uid = 'id1';
   title           
 ==================
   'hello user1'   

-- query with non-shardkey condition
SELECT title FROM mail WHERE mid < 3;
   title           
 ==================
   'hello user1'   
   'hello user2'
```
